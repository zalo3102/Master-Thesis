# Master-Thesis
## Overview
This repository was created with the aim of facilitating access to the codes and data used for the development of my Master's Thesis titled Gaussian Processes for predictive modeling in the low-data
 regime in Materials Science.
## Data Sources
In the Master's Thesis, two distinct problems were studied, each characterized by its own database:
- The file output_v2.csv corresponds to the dataset for the first problem (water molecule). 
- The file OCM_dataset.csv contains the dataset for the second problem (OCM reactions).
## Contents
- Data acquisition and preprocessing. 
- Characterization and analysis of the datasets through graphical data visualization. 
- Creation and training of the considered models in each case.

CODIGO_TFM.ipynb is intended for Google Colabâ€”make sure to adjust the .csv file paths for proper execution.
